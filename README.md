# ScratchJr

Sample projects and excecises for our budding young coders.

  * Fix the bugs: Three levels of simple trigger based excercises. Why doesn't it work? Can you fix it? Can you find an even better way to do it?
  * Under the sea: A sample scenario that uses most of the commands available. Play with it. Break it. See how it works. See if you can make it better.
